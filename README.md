# Qmind
finance team

This QMIND project attempts to develop and train a quantitative trading model with Machine Learning (tensorflow). 
The goal of this model is to try and identify market inefficiencies that can be used to generate profits.

Albeit a simple implementation, this project is a working version that is a good smart for future QMIND finance teams to improve upon.
